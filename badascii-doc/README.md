# BADASCII For RustDoc

Use `badascii` as a macro, and inject cool SVG diagrams into your
`rustdoc`, or wherever you might need them in your rust code.

Using it is super simple.

```shell
cargo add badascii-doc
```

And then in your code, simply use

```rust
#![doc = badascii!("
       +-------------+        +-------------+
       | Thing 1     |        | Thing 2     |
       |             |        |             |
  +--->|ins      outs+------->|ins      outs+----+
  |    |             |        |             |    |
  |    |             |        |             |    |
  |    +-------------+        +-------------+    |
  |                                              |
  +----------------------------------------------+
")]
```

And you will get a nice SVG rendering in your
generated markdown.  The SVG generated by these
macros is meant to be theme-agnostic.  They look
like this:

If you prefer a more formal diagram use the 
`badascii_formal!` macro, which gives straight
lines and no backtalk.

If you are worried about compile time performance,
well, then you can use `badascii-cli` to process
the comments yourself and generate `svg` images.
